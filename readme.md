## FastGlobalRegistration
Register two point clouds and estimate a rigid transformation.
### Description
This samples loads point cloud data from a file and
- creates a transformed version of the input cloud
- smoothes surface with the Moving Least Squares method
- computes surface normals
- computes Fast Point Feature Histogram (FPFH) feature description
- computes Fast Global Registration
- transforms second cloud back to its original position
### How to Run
This sample can be run on the emulator or any device with
AppEngine version 2.6.0 or higher and supporting PointClouds.
